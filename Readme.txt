First, store a pretrained word embedding model into this folder.
To do the preprocessing, first run idf_score.py, where you should set correct dataset and text type.
Then run sentence_embedding.py, where you should use the same dataset and text type as what you set in idf_score.py, and correctly set the word embedding model.
